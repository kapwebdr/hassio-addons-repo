# Home Assistant Community Add-on: InfluxDB2

InfluxDB is an open source time series database optimized for high-write-volume.
It's useful for recording metrics, sensor data, events,
and performing analytics. It exposes an HTTP API for client interaction and is
often used in combination with Grafana to visualize the data.

This add-on comes with Chronograf & Kapacitor pre-installed as well. Which
gives you a nice InfluxDB admin interface for managing your users, databases,
data retention settings, and lets you peek inside the database using the
Data Explorer.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Start the "InfluxDB2" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "InfluxDB2" to see if everything went well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button!

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
envvars:
  - name: INFLUXDB_HTTP_LOG_ENABLED
    value: "true"
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.
